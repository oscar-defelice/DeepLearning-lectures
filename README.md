# DeepLearning-lectures
Here is the material for a course of two-weeks I will be giving in a Master of Data Science and AI

This is part of a series of other lectures modules on

1. [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/DSAcademy-lectures) üßÆ
2. [Statistical Learning](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/ML-lectures) üìà
3. [Time Series](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/TimeSeries-lectures) ‚åõ
4. [Computer Vision Hands-On](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/Computer-Vision-Hands-on) üï∂Ô∏è


## Install requirements
As usual, it is advisable to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
One can follow [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and the suitable section according to the OS.

Once the virtual environment has been set up, one has to run the following instruction from a command line

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all the packages the code in this repository needs.

## Interact with notebooks

You can use _Binder_, to interact with notebooks and play with the code and the exercises.

I am a theoretical physicist, a passionate programmer and an AI curious.

I write medium articles (with very little amount of regularity), you can read them [here](https://oscar-defelice.medium.com/).
I also have a [github profile](https://github.com/oscar-defelice) where I store my personal open-source projects.
