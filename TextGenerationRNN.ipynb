    "There are two ways to tackle a natural language processing task like text generation. You can analyze the data and make predictions about it at the level of the words in the corpus or at the level of the individual characters. Both character-level generation and word-level generation have their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "In general, word-level language models tend to display higher accuracy than character-level language models. This is because they can form shorter representations of sentences and preserve the context between words easier than character-level language models. However, large corpuses are needed to sufficiently train word-level language models, and one-hot encoding isn't very feasible for word level models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, character-level language models are often quicker to train, requiring less memory and having faster inference than word-based models. This is because the \"vocabulary\" (the number of training features) for the model is likely to be much smaller overall, limited to some hundreds of characters rather than hundreds of thousands of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Character-based models also perform well when translating words between languages because they capture the characters which make up words, rather than trying to capture the semantic qualities of words. We'll be using a character-level model here, in part because of its simplicity and fast inference."
