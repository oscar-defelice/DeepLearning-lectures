# Deep Learning lectures

Here is the material for a course of two-weeks I will be giving in a Master of Data Science and AI

This is part of a series of other lectures modules on

1. [Introduction to Data Science](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/DSAcademy-lectures) üßÆ
2. [Statistical Learning](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/ML-lectures) üìà
3. [Time Series](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/TimeSeries-lectures) ‚åõ
4. [Computer Vision Hands-On](https://oscar-defelice.github.io/Computer-Vision-Hands-on) üï∂Ô∏è

## Install requirements

As usual, it is advisable to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
One can follow [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and the suitable section according to the OS.

Once the virtual environment has been set up, one has to run the following instruction from a command line

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all the packages the code in this repository needs.

### Mac M1 processors

For new Apple M1 processors, there is a different requirement file.
So set the virtual environment and then the command to execute is

```bash
pip install -r requirements-macm1.txt
```

This installs all the packages the code in this repository needs.

## Interact with notebooks

### Binder

You can use _Binder_, to interact with notebooks and play with the code and the exercises.

</p>

### DeepNote

Alternatively, you can work on these notebooks in another online workspace called [Deepnote](https://www.deepnote.com/). This allows you to play around with the code and access the assignments from your browser.

</p>

## Run lectures in a Docker container

</p>

Another option to run all these lectures locally is to build the corresponding Docker Image.
A nice introduction to Docker containers can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JprTjTViaEA).

We tried to modularise everything to make all the building and execution procedure as simple as possible.
To run a jupyter environment with all dependencies installed and notebooks ready to be executed it is sufficient to open your favourite terminal and run

```bash
make
```

The Makefile will take care of building and executing the docker image.
Then a jupyter server will be running at [http://localhost/8888](http://localhost/8888).
